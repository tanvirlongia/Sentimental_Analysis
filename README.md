# Sentimental_Analysis
I developed a comprehensive Python application for analyzing and managing reviews of locations retrieved from Google Maps. The project involved integrating various APIs, including Google Maps API for retrieving location details and reviews, TextBlob library for sentiment analysis, and SQLite for database management. The application compares the sentiment distribution of reviews between a main location and its surrounding locations. It visualizes the comparison using bar graphs.

The application generates visualizations to provide insights into the distribution of sentiments among reviews. It creates pie charts to visualize the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral reviews, as well as bar graphs to show the number of reviews per date.

It generates reports containing review details and visualizations and sends them via email using SMTP. Reports include attachments such as text files containing review data and PDFs of generated charts.
